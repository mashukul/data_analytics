# Project Context
Twitter is a popular microblogging service where users create status messages (called “tweets”).
These tweets sometimes express opinions about different topics. 
Twitter messages have many unique attributes, which differentiates twitter text classification from other classifications
Easy to collect millions of data
The frequency of misspelling and slang much higher
Has a Wide range of Topics
We need a method to automatically extract sentiment (positive or negative) from a tweet. 
Sentiment analysis without manual intervention is very useful because it allows feedback to be aggregated


# Business perspective

Consumers can analyse these sentiments to research products or services before making a purchase. 
Marketers can use this to research public opinion of their company and products, or to analyse customer satisfaction. Organizations can also use this to gather critical feedback about problems in newly released products.
